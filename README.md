# Django + Serverless + AWS Template

----

Hello everyone! This repository includes a work in progress to develop a 
template for quick deployment of a django app to an AWS Lambda
infrastructure using the Serverless framework.

Since this is a work in progress, contributors are required to open an issue first
and then make a PR referring that issue.

Some known issues which I could think of can be seen open.

For the initialization I used the aws-python serverless template and further worked on adding various modifications 
to make it django friendly.

Please ignore the name of the app as this template is being developed while working on a project (yes, a dating app xD).
